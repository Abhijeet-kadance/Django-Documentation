# Enviornment Setup

Install python on your system, for that check https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-install-python-in-windows

One more think to keep in mind

Check for the following things in your python folder

### Where is Pyhton installed on the system

    It may be installed inside C drive itself under the name "pyton39" because you installed 3.9 version and can be different like "pthon34".

    OR 

    It may be installed in C drive - Users - Your Username - App data - Local or roaming - Programs - Python.

### Check For these files inside Python Folder

    python.exe
    Scripts/pip.exe

    these files are important and would not cause any issues if they are present

    
Note :  If pip is not installed consider visiting this link
